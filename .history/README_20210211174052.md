# VaccinePassportAPI
This is report consists of API calls for Vaccine Passport Application. This application is built on top of Hedera Hashgraph(Blockchain),Nodejs and MysSQL

# Prerequisites
1. Hedera testnet or mainnet account.
2. Node.js

# I just want to run quickly
You can deploy backend service with below commands.
# Project Setup
npm install
# App run 
npm start


# Scenario
Task: This api call is to register the patient details to the blockchain.
Scenario: Create patient details into Hedera network
Given a petient details and blockchain available
when patient details are registered 
then patient details are stored into file service.
when I get file id 
and I will create a json object.
then object is stored into file service.
when patient file id created.
then file id added to the token.
and token create function is called.
then it responses token details

# About project 
## Name : Vaccine Passport
## How we built it
1. Vaccine passport is an android application which uses active Hedera Token Service.
2. The main usecase of this application is to create a vaccine passport identity for the patients/users who vaccinates.
3. The major resources used from Hedera are Hedera account creation, Hedera Token Servie and Hedera File Services.
4. From mobile application case worker/employee enters the patients details and vaccine details that specific dose.
5. Firstly, these details are stored in Hedera file Service.
6. Patient record is created as token with following parameters; name of the token: patient name, token symbol: patient file id and other parameters respectively.
7. Once the token is create names a patient token, this token will be used to the user.
8. Case worker can see the patient details he as created. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. Initially it took ages to understand the Hedera Token Services.
2. Hedera documentation was great but implementing from scratch was biggest task.
3. HTS demo application helped us to moving forward to next steps.
4. There was many issues with SDK version. For every new upgrade we used to face many problems.
5. Also siging with multiple signature was big confused.

## BUGS:
1. Describe the bug
Queries for account info occasionally throw an error due to insufficient fee. This is due to a bug in the SDK which incorrectly compares the query cost (actual cost) with the maximum set for the client or query.
This issue will be closed when the SDK has been fixed in this respect.
Expected behaviour
Queries do not throw an error
 
2. ok, so token create transaction, you can set a memo with .setTransactionMemo.

## These are the question rise while brainstorming:
1. HTS token creation and customising the token. 
2. What steps, services and  parameters are required?
3. Can Smart contracts used for implementing this usecase?
4. Using smart contracts can we access hts?
5. High level requirements

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Yahoo! finally we could able to solve the Hackathon with our usecase.
2. Applied most of Hedera Token Service features in the application.
3. Created API's for all the method used for patient token creations.
 
## What we learned
1. In this Hackathon we have learned the main usecase of HTS.
2. Appling these features on the real world scenario.
3. Also, completed all the mini challenges. 
4. Interacted with the sponsors.
