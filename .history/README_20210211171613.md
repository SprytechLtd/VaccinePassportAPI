# About project 
## Name : Vaccine Passport
## How we built it
1. Vaccine passport is an android application which uses active Hedera Token Service.
2. The main usecase of this application is to create a vaccine passport identity for the patients/users who vaccinates.
3. The major resources used from Hedera are Hedera account creation, Hedera Token Servie and Hedera File Services.
4. From mobile application case worker/employee enters the patients details and vaccine details that specific dose.
5. Firstly, these details are stored in Hedera file Service.
6. Patient record is created as token with following parameters; name of the token: patient name, token symbol: patient file id and other parameters respectively.
7. Once the token is create names a patient token, this token will be used to the user.
8. Case worker can see the patient details he as created. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. Initially it took ages to understand the Hedera Token Services.
2. Hedera documentation was great but implementing from scratch was biggest task.
3. HTS demo application helped us to moving forward to next steps.
